This repository showcases the implementation of our 7th-semester major engineering project, developed as part of the B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology under the guidance of Dr. P. Velmurugan.

📌 Overview
The AI-based chatbot model aims to optimize hospital management and improve patient experience using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Acting as a virtual assistant, it helps patients access essential information such as doctor availability, hospital timings, ward types, bed prices, and more—streamlining healthcare navigation with human-like interactions.

💡 Core Features
🧠 LLM-powered chatbot using models like GPT and Instructor-XL

💬 Handles medical FAQs and real-time queries

🏥 Recommends doctors based on symptoms

🗓 Displays doctor schedules and hospital hours

💾 Backend support with PostgreSQL for data storage

🧹 Advanced NLP: text preprocessing, lemmatization, stopword removal

🧪 Trained with organization-provided PDFs, chunked and embedded using Langchain & FAISS

📋 UI built with Streamlit, styled via HTML/CSS

🧰 API testing and communication via Postman

⚙️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Frameworks/Libraries: Streamlit, LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers, FAISS, PyPDFLoader

Database: PostgreSQL

Tools: Postman, AWS S3 (for PDF storage), HTML/CSS for UI

🧪 Testing & Output
The chatbot successfully answered diverse queries with screenshots attached in the report (e.g., "Doctor charges", "Ward types", etc.), validating its robustness and accuracy.

🚀 Future Scope
Voice input/output for hands-free use

Multilingual support for wider reach

Appointment reminders and feedback integration

Enhanced medical NLU for complex symptom queries

📄 Report
Full technical documentation and codebase structure are included for academic reference and practical deployment.
